- __Objects__: literals, enhanced literals, property descriptors, json;
- __Functions__: types, returns, 1st class functions.

## What you need?

Here's a list of things you need:

1. a laptop & power-plug
2. a code editor (_optional_)
3. [Node.js][download_node] 4.0+ (_optional_)

## Who is it for?

- Beginner & Intermediate JavaScript developers who want to discover the language at a deeper level
- Advanced developers, who switched to JavaScript recently and want to understand its mechanics

* any terminal on Linux.

### 1. Create project folder

First, you need to create a new folder somewhere on your computer:

```
cd [WORK_FOLDER]

cd [PROJECT_NAME]
```

### 2. Clone project skeleton

Second, you need to clone this repository. If you have git installed, you can:
