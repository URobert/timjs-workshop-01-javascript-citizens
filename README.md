#Workshop JS Fundamentals

Welcome to the first JavaScript workshop, organized by tim.js.

## Prerequisites

Here's a list of things you need:

* a laptop
* a code editor
* Node.js installed on your computer (version 4.x or 5.x)
* git installed on your computer (this is actually optional)

## Setup

Here are some steps you can follow to setup the workshop skeleton.
All these commands need to be run from the command line (Terminal on Mac/Linux, Cmd on Win).

### Create project folder

First, you need to create a new folder somewhere on your computer:

```
cd [WORK_FOLDER]
mkdir [PROJECT_NAME]
cd [PROJECT_NAME]
```

### Clone project skeleton

Second, you need to clone this repository. If you have git installed, you can:

`git clone ... ./`

... if you don't have git, then download this repo and unzip it in your PROJECT_NAME folder.

### Install dependencies

`npm install`

### Run project

`gulp`

This should display a URL in the console, where you can load the project page.
